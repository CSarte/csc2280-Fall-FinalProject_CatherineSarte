There is one code file and one test case text files. 

1. Begin program by hitting the create study set button
2. Then either enter your questions and answers with the proived test case or write in your own
	note: 
		- When entering the set from a dialog always use a copy. After collecting the data from the file the code 
	leaves the file you get information from and save to empty.
		- Also, even if you are just typing in the QandA's you will need to choose a file to save to.
		- IF you make your own, I also suggest having answers with more than 4 letters because the open_ended section
	allows for a 2 typo leniancy
3. Everything else should be self explanatory and their are instruction windows throughout the code to help you.

4. There may be a problem with windows getting in your way, while the program doesn't like it, I suggest either exited
it out or minimizing it
	-although if you do this and the window was set to be lifted it will minimize the window its connected, so you 
	will just need to tab back to it. 

Basic order of steps:
 1. start code
 2. hit create set button
 3. Hit enter set button and choose file to import data from (or skip to next step)
 4. Make any edits to the imported data or write in more questions
 5. hit save button and choose a file to save your data through
 6. exit/minimize the enter set window
 7. If list is correct hit learn set button
 8. hit start game whenever you are ready
 9. Go through learning game
 10. Once, completed either reset game and start back at step 9 or return to main menu
 11. And you're done! Main menu should display your diagnostics from the program
 12. Hit the x in the corner or stop the program when you are ready to leave
